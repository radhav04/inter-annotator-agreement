# Inter Annotator Agreement Project

This project takes in JSON files with tagged CAMEO Codes from The University of Texas at Dallas' proprietary CAMEO encoding scheme and checks inter-annotator agreement. Two annotator folders must be provided, and the program will give statistical analysis based on the correspondence of the annotators. The project stores all annotator data in Pandas dataframes.
