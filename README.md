# Inter Annotator Agreement Project

This project takes in JSON files with tagged CAMEO Codes from The University of Texas at Dallas' proprietary CAMEO encoding scheme and checks inter-annotator agreement. Three annotator folders must be provided: one for a human annotator, one for the corresponding human annotator, and one for the algorithm generated codes. Next, the program will give statistical analysis based on the correspondence of the annotators and stores all annotator data in Pandas dataframes.
